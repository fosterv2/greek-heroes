# Greek Heroes Rails Application

Greek Heroes is an application inspired by my interest in Greek Mythology. The point of this application is for a user to be able to create heroes decended from an Olympian God and inherit their affinity. They can have their heroes battle a monster and see who won.

## Usage

Once you start the application on your browser it will automatically redirect to the welcome page. A user must sign in to do anything interesting. Once signed in there are options on the home page for other pages to visit or things to do in the app.
