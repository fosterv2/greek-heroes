# Greek Heroes Rails Application

Greek Heroes is an application inspired by my interest in Greek Mythology.
The point of this application is for a user to be able to create heroes decended from an Olympian God and inherit their affinity. They can have their heroes battle a monster and see who won.

## Usage

Once you start the application on your browser it will automatically redirect to the welcome page.
A user must be signed in to do anything interesting.
Once signed in there are options for pages to go to in the app.
