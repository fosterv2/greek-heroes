# GreekHeroes Rails Application

GreekHeroes is an application inspired by my interest in Greek Mythology.

This project was started with [Rails New](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html).

GreekHeroes deployed through Heroku [here](https://greek-heroes.herokuapp.com/)

## Prerequisites

To run this project you have to have rails installed on your computer

## Installing

To use this app you should fork and clone this repository to your local machine. Then cd into the project folder and run these commands: 

```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```
then `rails s` to start the server

## Using GreekHeroes

Once you start the application on your browser it will automatically redirect to the welcome page. A user must sign in to do anything interesting. Once signed in there are options on the home page for other pages to visit or things to do in the app. The point of this application is for a user to be able to create heroes decended from an Olympian God and inherit their affinity. They can have their heroes battle a monster and see who won.
